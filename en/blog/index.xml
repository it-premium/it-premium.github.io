      <description>&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Research suggests that Eutelsat, particularly through OneWeb, could partially replace Starlink in Ukraine’s war with Russia, though it’s a complex process.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Eutelsat offers both geostationary (GEO) and low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites, providing high-speed internet with low latency, similar to Starlink.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Switching to Eutelsat would require significant investment in new equipment, which could be challenging during wartime.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;European backing for Eutelsat could help Ukraine reduce reliance on a single provider.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the context of Ukraine’s war with Russia, satellite internet has become vital for maintaining communication, especially after the destruction of traditional networks. Starlink, developed by SpaceX, has been a key tool for Ukraine, delivering fast and reliable internet access. However, with potential shifts in U.S. support, a question arises: can Eutelsat, a European satellite operator, serve as a viable alternative? This overview analyzes Eutelsat’s technologies, compares them with Starlink, and evaluates the feasibility of replacement amid the ongoing conflict.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Majorana 1 Breakthrough: Top 5 Reasons It’s Revolutionizing Quantum Computing</title>
      <link>https://it-premium.com.ua/en/blog/majorana-1-top-5/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Quantum computing just took a giant leap forward with Microsoft’s Majorana 1, the world’s first quantum processor powered by topological qubits. Announced in February 2025, this innovative chip promises to transform the field with unmatched stability, scalability, and efficiency. But what makes Majorana 1 a true breakthrough? Here are the top 5 reasons why this Microsoft quantum chip is turning heads and rewriting the future of technology.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;1-topological-qubits-the-game-changer-in-stability&#34;&gt;1. Topological Qubits: The Game-Changer in Stability&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The standout feature of Majorana 1 is its use of topological qubits, based on Majorana particles. Unlike traditional qubits, which are prone to errors from environmental noise, topological qubits offer topological protection. This inherent stability reduces decoherence, a long-standing challenge in quantum computing. Microsoft’s breakthrough with Majorana 1 means more reliable computations, bringing practical quantum solutions closer than ever.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;key-points&#34;&gt;Key Points&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Majorana 1 uses a new material called topoconductor, made from indium arsenide and aluminum, built atom by atom for precision.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;It operates by creating a topological state at near absolute zero with magnetic fields, forming Majorana Zero Modes for stable qubits.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Microsoft measured fermion parity in the topoconductor, a key step in controlling Majorana particles, detailed in a Nature paper.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The chip is palm-sized with eight qubits now, aiming to scale to a million, but experts question the scalability.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Some experts are skeptical, noting challenges in scaling from eight to a million qubits.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-is-majorana-1-and-its-fresh-facts&#34;&gt;What is Majorana 1 and Its Fresh Facts?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Majorana 1 is Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s new quantum chip, announced in February 2025, using topological qubits for potentially more stable and scalable quantum computing. Here are some fresh and lesser-known details:&lt;/p&gt;</description>
