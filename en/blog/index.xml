      <description>&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;It seems likely that the tj-actions/changed-files GitHub Action was compromised in a supply chain attack, potentially leaking secrets from CI/CD pipelines.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Research suggests the attack started around March 14, 2025, affecting over 23,000 repositories, with secrets exposed in public build logs.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The evidence leans toward the malicious code dumping CI runner memory, with secrets double-encoded in base64 for public visibility.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The tj-actions/changed-files is a popular GitHub Action used to identify changed files in repositories, aiding in CI/CD processes. Recently, it has been at the center of a security incident that could impact many users relying on automated workflows.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Research suggests that Eutelsat, particularly through OneWeb, could partially replace Starlink in Ukraine’s war with Russia, though it’s a complex process.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Eutelsat offers both geostationary (GEO) and low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites, providing high-speed internet with low latency, similar to Starlink.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Switching to Eutelsat would require significant investment in new equipment, which could be challenging during wartime.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;European backing for Eutelsat could help Ukraine reduce reliance on a single provider.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the context of Ukraine’s war with Russia, satellite internet has become vital for maintaining communication, especially after the destruction of traditional networks. Starlink, developed by SpaceX, has been a key tool for Ukraine, delivering fast and reliable internet access. However, with potential shifts in U.S. support, a question arises: can Eutelsat, a European satellite operator, serve as a viable alternative? This overview analyzes Eutelsat’s technologies, compares them with Starlink, and evaluates the feasibility of replacement amid the ongoing conflict.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Marjorana 1 detailed analysis</title>
      <link>https://it-premium.com.ua/en/blog/majorana-1-detailed-analysis/</link>

      <description>&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Majorana 1 uses a new material called topoconductor, made from indium arsenide and aluminum, built atom by atom for precision.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;It operates by creating a topological state at near absolute zero with magnetic fields, forming Majorana Zero Modes for stable qubits.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Microsoft measured fermion parity in the topoconductor, a key step in controlling Majorana particles, detailed in a Nature paper.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The chip is palm-sized with eight qubits now, aiming to scale to a million, but experts question the scalability.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Some experts are skeptical, noting challenges in scaling from eight to a million qubits.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Majorana 1 is Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s new quantum chip, announced in February 2025, using topological qubits for potentially more stable and scalable quantum computing. Here are some fresh and lesser-known details:&lt;/p&gt;</description>
